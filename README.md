# Investment Tracker

## Description

This project aims to create a tool for tracking stocks and investments on investment platforms. The original idea for this project was when I was about to buy a SteamDeck. Then I thought better of it and started to wonder how much the money would grow over time if I invested it instead. I realized that it would require me to keep track of the assets that I purchase a particular month, even if I sell them and buy new ones later on. Or if I get dividends and reinvest them.

With this project, I am able to parse data from my investment platform, keep latest asset values up to date and calculate relevant statistics.

This project is a work in progress and will be updated as I go along.

## Features

- Parse and store data from an investment platform.
- Keep track of where money invested each month is moved and grown over time.
- Calculate statistics for months and years:
    - Deposit
    - Withdrawal
    - Current Value
    - Total Gain/Loss
    - Realized Gain/Loss
    - Unrealized Gain/Loss
    - APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
- Two viewing modes:
    - **Period-specific**: Track performance of investments made in each month/year
    - **Accumulated**: See total portfolio value over time with assets carried forward

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Import your transaction data
python cli.py import data/your_transactions.csv

# 2. Get statistics with automatic price updates
python cli.py stats --update-prices auto --period year --deposits all

# 3. Check system status anytime
python cli.py status
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

A unified CLI is available via `cli.py`. It provides subcommands for all major operations:

#### Modern Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Import CSV data and process transactions in one atomic operation
python cli.py import data/transactions.csv

# Show statistics with smart updates (auto-updates prices if stale)
python cli.py stats --update-prices auto --period year --deposits all

# Check system status (transactions, prices, metadata)
python cli.py status

# Reset database state (mark all transactions as unprocessed)
python cli.py reset
```

All commands accept optional `--database` and `--special-cases` arguments to override default paths:

```bash
python cli.py --database path/to/db.db --special-cases path/to/special.json import data.csv
```

#### Smart Update Features

The new `stats` command includes intelligent caching and update logic:

- **Price freshness**: Prices are considered "fresh" if updated within 1 day
- **Auto-update**: `--update-prices auto` updates only if prices are stale
- **Force update**: `--update-prices always` forces price refresh
- **Skip update**: `--update-prices never` uses cached prices
- **Stats caching**: Statistics are recalculated only when needed (new transactions or price updates)

### Understanding Statistics Output

The statistics output has two modes that serve different purposes:

#### 1. Regular Statistics (Default)
```bash
python cli.py stats --period month
```
- **Shows**: Activity for each specific month/year
- **"Value" column**: Current value of deposits made **during that specific period**
- **If zero deposits in a period**: Value = 0 (by definition)
- **If everything withdrawn**: Value = 0 (deposits fully withdrawn)
- **Use case**: Track performance of investments made in each period

#### 2. Accumulated Statistics
```bash
python cli.py stats --period month --accumulated
```
- **Shows**: Cumulative portfolio value over time
- **"Value" column**: Total portfolio value at period end (all assets held)
- **Carries forward**: Assets from earlier periods continue to appear
- **Use case**: See total portfolio growth over time

#### Example
**January 2024:**
- Deposit: 10,000 SEK
- Buy Asset A: 10,000 SEK
- Current price of Asset A: 12,000 SEK

**February 2024:**
- No deposits/withdrawals
- Asset A still held (worth 12,000 SEK)

**Regular stats show:**
- January: Value = 12,000 SEK (value of January deposit)
- February: Value = 0 (no February deposits)

**Accumulated stats show:**
- January: Value = 12,000 SEK
- February: Value = 12,000 SEK (asset carried forward)

### CSV Format Support

The parser automatically detects whether your CSV file uses Avanza's old or new export format (the new format includes a `Transaktionsvaluta` column). The following transaction types are recognized:

- Insättning (deposit)
- Uttag (withdrawal)
- Köp (purchase)
- Sälj (sale)
- Utdelning (dividend)
- Räntor / Ränta / Inlåningsränta (interest)
- Utländsk källskatt / Prelskatt / Preliminärskatt (taxes)
- Byte / Övrigt (listing changes)
- Tillgångsinsättning (asset deposit)

Empty numeric fields (like `Antal`, `Kurs`) are treated as zero.

**Price fetching note:** The `stats` command (with `--update-prices auto` or `--update-prices always`) fetches current asset prices from Avanza's public search API (`www.avanza.se/_api/search/filtered-search`). This API is intended for web frontend use and may have rate limits or terms of service restrictions. Use at your own risk and consider using official APIs if available. Always review the website's terms of service before using their data.

### Using the CLI (Recommended)

The unified CLI provides all functionality in a streamlined interface:

1. Add transaction data in CSV format to the `data` folder.
    - You might need to create a "special_cases.json" file in order to match and replace certain values in the data. See file specification in the documentation for the SpecialCases class.
2. Import and process transactions: `python cli.py import data/your_transactions.csv`
3. View statistics with automatic price updates: `python cli.py stats --update-prices auto`
4. Check system status: `python cli.py status`
